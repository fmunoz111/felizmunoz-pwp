#### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job putting together a persona and website goals that are both very fleshed out and work well together! I can totally imagine this persona and see how her needs line up with your goals you've defined.

I really like how you specifically defined Erika's interaction with your website for the user story. It provides you with a lot of guidance moving into your UI design and content strategy when you have something like that in mind. I look forward to seeing your site focus on usability and emphasize your front end web dev experience.

You have a few minor errors in set up that I detail more below, but overall your HTML looks really good and is organized uniquely but effectively. Nice work!

Your Milestone 1 passes at a [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

#### Edits & Suggestions
* You missed the .idea directory in your .gitignore by switching the . and /, so the .idea dir got pushed to GitHub by accident.
* Remember to create a README.md for new repos - this is where you can add information that others will need to know about your projects later on.
* You have a picture in your repo that you don't end up linking to. Remember to clean as you go and keep your git repos organized. 
* Side note: the git@githitub.com URLs are used for doing git commands from the command line but don't do much outside of that. You can click on "Use HTTPS" from the "Clone or download" tab to see the normal web URL for linking to GitHub projects!
