## Milestone 2a Feedback
Great job on your Milestone 2a! You clearly have a solid sense of what you want your personal website to be and you went to great detail to highlight that here. I like your wireframes and the attention you paid to interactivity, like the rotating testimonials. The music idea is fun - sometimes people don't like music that automatically plays on sites, but I personally think having a music player with music you like on it even if it doesn't auto-play would be great. Solid job!

Your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier III.

## Milestone 3
Beautiful PWP!! I love the color scheme and images you used, and it flows very intuitively without being too busy or crowded. Your site mostly looks great on mobile - you have some text that overlaps and should be spaced out but otherwise looks great and works well.

In your project file structure, try to keep your images organized in an image folder - otherwise your PHP and JS look great!

Your Milestone 3 passes at a Tier IV.
