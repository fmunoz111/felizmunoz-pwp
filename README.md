## Milestone 2a Feedback
Great job on your Milestone 2a! You clearly have a solid sense of what you want your personal website to be and you went to great detail to highlight that here. I like your wireframes and the attention you paid to interactivity, like the rotating testimonials. The music idea is fun - sometimes people don't like music that automatically plays on sites, but I personally think having a music player with music you like on it even if it doesn't auto-play would be great. Solid job!

Your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier III.
