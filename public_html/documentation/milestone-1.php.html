			Goal
		</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>I believe that the purpose of and most effective use of my personal web project is to help me once the bootcamp is complete.  My personal website will be a first look for those interested in me and my work.  Future employers will be able to have a glimpse into my life as a web developer; they will have first access to information about me, my resume, my portfolio of work, what I am interested in working in, what I excell at, and how I am willing to grow as a developer. </p>
		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>The intended audience of my personal website will be future employers, clients, customers, other developers, professional peers, future co-workers, people I network with, and my cohort.</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>My main goal of my personal website is to intrigue potentional employers in order to acquire a part time or full time job.  Another goal is to attact freelance clients, provide a gallery of my work and what platforms I work best on, and get my name out in the community in a digital way.</p>
