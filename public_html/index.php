						<h2 class="about me">About</h2>
						<p>Hello!  I am Feliz Munoz and I am a native New Mexican full stack web developer.  I have recently completed the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through CNM Ingenuity.  I have experince with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP, and Angular. I have a background in working for non-profits, event organization, teaching, and working in teams.  I am a driven individual and I adapt to any environment I am in.  I am goal oriented, I enjoy routine, I have strong communication skills and always strive for more out of life.</p>

						<br>

						<p>I am an active member of a non-profit known as the Organ Transplant Awareness Program where we aim to spread the awareness of organ donation in Albuquerque.  I began the Transplant Trek in 2011 and OTAP has since then become co-host of the walk where proceeds benefit the Jaime Munoz Scholarship and the Betty Montoya Scholarship.  I have a passion for bettering the community I am from and I want to use web development to continue my help to Albuquerque.</p>

				<p class="text-center">Throughout the course of the bootcamp we had two major projects to work on.   One project is the web page you are looking at now and this project was all about front end.  I came into this bootcamp with extremely little background in anything computer related; I have come a long way!  I used HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap for this project.</p>
				<hr class="my-4">
				<p class="text-center">The second project that we had going on during the bootcamp was our capstone project that we worked on in teams.  My group and I created Family Connect.  Family Connect is a platform for families and large groups to communicate on.  What sets our site aside from others alike is an event and task component.  Family Connect allows families to plan get togethers, parties and more.  The task component allows for families to assign tasks for one another with due dates.  Our stack includes MySQL, PHP, Angular, Bootstrap, CSS, SCSS, HTML5, and JavaScript.  My group and I submitted our web app to the UNM/CNM App Competition and are hoping to come out with the W.  The link will be availabe once our web app is too!</p>
